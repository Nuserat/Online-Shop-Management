This project has two types of user namely admin and customer. Admins can add products detail (product id, name, price,
quantity etc.) by login to their account using their email and password. On the other hand the
customers can buy those products and generate payment receipt for every customer. Productsâ€™ quantity will be increased if admins add more quantity to that product using its product id.
